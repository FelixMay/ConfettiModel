# ConfettiModel

## Dynamic and spatial simulations of ecological communities

The CONFETTI model simulates community dynamics of sessile individuals such as
trees or shrubs.

The model is dynamic and spatially-explicit, which means each individual is 
characterized by its position in two-dimensional space.

Modelled processes are mortality and recruitment. Both of these processes
can depend on the interaction among individuals

The name is simply derived from a snapshot of the model. If each
individual is represented as a circle and the color indicates the species identity 
a plot of all individuals in the community looks like confetti.

The model has been used in the following scientific publications. 

When you use the CONFETTI model in your work, please cite at least on of the following 
articles.

Complete model descriptions are provided in these articles as well
